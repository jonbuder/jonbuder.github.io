                Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division. Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz". It is also used in computer programming to demonstrate use of logic and can be implemented in many different ways.
